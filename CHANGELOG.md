CHANGELOG

## Version 0.04

### Highlights
- **Async Support**: Introduced asynchronous request handling, allowing multiple API calls to be processed concurrently. This reduces total computation time significantly.
- **Performance Improvements**: Based on a sample size of 15, the average processing time is now under 1 second—a **50% improvement** over previous versions. This is especially beneficial when dealing with varying API response times due to provider or model load.

### Other Enhancements
- **Code Quality**:
  - Improved code annotations for better readability.
  - Refactored and reorganized code for maintainability.
- **Shoutout**: Special thanks to our LLM models for assisting in code optimizations and documentation.

*Exciting news—enjoy the faster and cleaner experience!*
